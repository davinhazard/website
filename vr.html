			<h3>Snapshot</h3>
			<p>Magic Muffin is an immersive, interactive music experience that transports the user from a mundane office space to a colorful, playfull space of music and interaction. Over the course of a month, I worked with a team of three others to design, develop, test, and showcase our game.</p>
			<h5>Technologies + Languages:</h5>
			<p>Unreal Engine 4, HTC Vive, C++</p>
			<h5>Role:</h5>
			<p>Designer, Developer</p>

				<h3>Description + Process</h3>
				<p>For a final project in my graduate-level VR class, we were tasked with building an interactive game using Unreal Engine 4 and the HTC Vive. With intermittent progress deadlines, we had six weeks to brainstorm, build, debug, and demo our game.</p>
				<p>I found three teammates who shared an interest in creating an immersive experience that focused on visuals and music interaction. In the beginning stages of our development, we wrote a full-length design document to thoroughly outline the premise, features, and implementation of our game. An early challenge was scaling our project to be feasible within our given timeline.</p>

			<p>The premise of our game was to transport the user from a simulated mundane office space to a colorful musical environment, where both the objects and the user could interact with music.</p>
			<p>A substantial amount of my contribution was devoted to level design and implementing music interaction. I chose colorful low-poly objects to populate the music level, both for its whimsical aesthetic and its computational rendering benefit. Too many or too complex of scene objects caused lagging and thus discomfort when using the VR headset. Additionally, I used Unreal Engineâ€™s native programming tools to utilize components of the song, such as beats per minute, to make objects spin, grow, or change color to the music.</p>
			<p>I also pair-programmed a C++ class to procedurally generate pop-able bubbles in the scene to slowly drift toward the user and pop when touched.</p>
			<p>The biggest challenges with this project were establishing an efficient workflow in UE4 and working with the often finnicky hardware. Ultimately our project was well-received and was a fun way to explore the playful side of VR and the vast capabilities of Unreal Engine. </p>
